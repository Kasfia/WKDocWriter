WKDocWriter is a class for saving NSAttributedStrings as Microsoft Word files on iOS.

Supports:
 - Bold/Italic/Underline
 - Font and font size
 - Alignment
 - Line Spacing
 - Indention

May support in the future:
 - Stylesheet
 - Document Properties

Known issues:
 - Document preview does not appear in Quicklook
 - Appkit's NSAttributedString does not read the file properly. (Pages and Word work fine.)
 - Text is limited to ~53,000 characters (due to File Allocation Table assuming only one 512-byte sector).
 - Formatting is not written as efficiently as it could be.
